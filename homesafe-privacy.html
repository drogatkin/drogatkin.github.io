     <h1>Privacy policy for Android app HomeSafe</h1>
    <p>HomeSafe doesn't collect or use any user's location data beyond required the application functionality.</p>
    <p>Such location data isn't store anywhere besides of the application itself.</p>
    <p>The same is true for e-mails, or phone numbers.</p>
    <p>Say more, HomeSafe doesn't use Internet at all, so location data can't leak anyway.</p>
    <p>The application can send a user controlled SMS to specified by a user addresses as the main purpose of the app.</P>
